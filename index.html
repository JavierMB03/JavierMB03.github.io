        <p>I am from Oxnard, which is about an <strong>hour</strong> away from LA.</p>
        <p>I'm a third-year transfer in <strong>Computer Science</strong> ,and I currently do not have a concentration.</p>
        <p>A fun fact about me is that I can <em>whistle</em> four different ways.</p>
        <p>I enjoy playing <em>chess</em> and going to the gym during my free time. </p>
