# Javier's Personal Website
This is a personal website built using the Hack4Impact Starter Pack!
I am from Oxnard, which is about an hour away from LA. I'm a third-year transfer in Computer Science, and I currently do not have a concentration. A fun fact about me is that I can whistle four different ways. I enjoy playing chess and going to the gym during my free time.
